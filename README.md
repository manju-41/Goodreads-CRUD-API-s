# Goodreads-CRUD-APIs
A CRUD API is an application programming interface that enables a client to create, read, update, and delete data from a database. In a CRUD API project using Node.js and Express, you would build a server-side application that exposes a set of endpoints for performing these operations on a particular resource or set of resources.
